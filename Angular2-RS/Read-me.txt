Angular 7 version POST for Content-Type application/json is not working, because of CORS setting, it resets back to text/plain.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39689386/fetch-post-json-data-application-json-change-to-text-plain

When a webservice is configured to consume application/json, the above will not work, so change it to text/plain, change the headers in the AnimalService
to text/plain, and it is working. At server side, use toold for converting JSON to objects and handle the stuff. 



---------Finally got it working ----------------------------------------------------
Changed the tomcat version to 8.5.32 which supports  JDK 1.8 and the post also is working fine.
